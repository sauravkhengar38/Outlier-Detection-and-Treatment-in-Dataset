🔹 Project Overview:<br>
  I developed a Python script to detect and handle outliers in my dataset using various statistical techniques.

🔹 Techniques Used:<br>
📈 1. Mean, Median, and Mode substitution<br>
🧢 2. Capping Technique (limiting extreme values)<br>
🧮 3. Quartile-Based Methods (IQR - Interquartile Range)<br>

🔹 Process:

➡️ Detected outliers using the IQR method.

➡️ Treated outliers by replacing them with the mean, median, or mode depending on the data type and distribution.

➡️ Applied capping to limit extreme values within acceptable thresholds instead of removing them.

🔹 Result:<br>
✅ Outliers were effectively handled, resulting in a cleaner, more consistent, and analysis-ready dataset.
